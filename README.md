# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This game was created as a part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). It is a browser-based arcade game.

## How to play

In order to play the game, clone this repository to your computer using the `$ git clone` command and open `index.html` in your browser. Alternatively you can download [this zip file](https://github.com/klobuli/udacity-arcade-game-clone/archive/master.zip) or simply play the game [directly on GitHub](https://klobuli.github.io/udacity-arcade-game-clone/).

## Game logic

First the player chooses the character he wants to play with.

Once the choice is made, the game starts. The goal of the player is to reach the water without colliding into the enemies, which are crossing the screen with different speeds. Pressing the arrow keys will move the player into the intended directions. Collisions with the enemies will reset the game.

The game includes a star rating, based on how many times the player reached the water without colliding into an enemy.
